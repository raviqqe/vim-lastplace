INTRODUCTION                                    *vim-pastplace-introduction*

Intelligently reopen files where you left off.  By default git,
svn, and mercurial commit messages are ignored because you
probably want to type a new message and not re-edit the previous
one.

You can configure what file types to ignore by setting
g:pastplace_ignore in your vimrc. By default it is set to:

        let g:pastplace_ignore = "gitcommit,gitrebase,svn,hgcommit"

By default, folds are automatically opened when jumping to the last edit
position. If you do not like this behavior you can disable it by putting
this in your vimrc:

        let g:pastplace_open_folds = 0
