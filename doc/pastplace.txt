*INTRODUCTION*                                      *pastplace-introduction*

pastplace lets you restore the last cursor position when opening files edited
before.

CONFIGURATION                                     *pastplace-configuration*

You can configure what file types to ignore by setting
g:pastplace_ignore in your vimrc. By default it is set to:

    let g:pastplace_ignore = ['gitcommit', 'gitrebase', 'svn', 'hgcommit']
